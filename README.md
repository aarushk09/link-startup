# link-startup

To run, first cd into link-startup. Then do the following command: python manage.py makemigrations. Then do: python manage.py migrate. Then do: python manage.py createsuperuser. The program will ask for a user/pass/email. Make it up, the email doesn't matter (I recommend doing user: admin, password: admin). Then remember the user/pass and type: python manage.py runserver. Open the dev server that is created, and register through the credentials you made earlier.
